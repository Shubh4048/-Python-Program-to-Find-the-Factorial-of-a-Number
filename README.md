# -Python-Program-to-Find-the-Factorial-of-a-Number
This code takes an integer input from the user and prints the factorial of the entered number.

What is Factorial?
Factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

Example:
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

Approach:
Initialize fact = 1
Run a loop from 1 to n
Multiply each value with fact
Return fact at the end
This is an iterative approach using a simple loop.
